<h2> About Me </h2>

  <p> 
    Hi! I'm Jefferson Ganacias. Most people call me Jeff but I prefer Jep instead, just for a bit of difference.
    'm currently figuring things out to build a fulfilling future. Typically writing my 'Once Upon A Slice of Life'.

<h2> Get To KNow Me </h2>

  <p>
    I'm  currently a junior student at West Visayas Stae University -  Main Campus, taking up a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems major in Business Applications Development.
    Expensive as it sounds though but... Anyways, I'm intuitive and optimistic, it is tested and proven after I've been through for the past 10 years and that I'm on my 20's.
    I'm fond of journaling and planning, as well as management, it is something that keeps me going every single day. And one thing that keeps me alive is "to achieve my purposse and be           fulfilled in lie."
